**Introduction**

This document outlines the lifecycle of a disposable paper cup and its associated environmental impacts.

**Phases of Environmental Impact:**

1. **Raw Material Extraction:**
    * **Deforestation:** Tree cutting for wood pulp leads to deforestation, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline.
    * **Petroleum Extraction:** Production of plastic lining (polyethylene) involves extracting and refining petroleum, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution.

2. **Manufacturing Process:**
    * **High Energy Consumption:** Manufacturing requires significant energy from fossil fuels, further increasing carbon emissions.
    * **Water Usage:** Paper production is water-intensive, contributing to water scarcity in some regions.
    * **Chemical Pollution:** Use of chemicals like bleach releases harmful byproducts into the environment.

3. **Transportation:**
    * **Carbon Footprint:** Transporting cups from manufacturing to distribution and end-users generates significant carbon emissions.

4. **Usage Phase:**
    * **Short Lifespan:** Designed for single-use, leading to a massive volume of waste.

5. **Disposal Phase:**
    * **Landfill Pollution:** Plastic lining prevents biodegradation, leading to long-term landfill contamination and methane emissions.
    * **Low Recycling Rates:** Difficulty in separating plastic and paper components hinders recycling efforts.
    * **Ocean Pollution:** Improper disposal contributes to plastic pollution in oceans, harming marine life.

6. **Long-Term Impact:**
    * **Microplastic Pollution:** Plastic lining degrades into microplastics, contaminating soil and water, and entering the food chain.
    * **Resource Depletion:** Non-recyclable nature leads to the waste of valuable resources (trees, water, energy).

**Solutions:**

* **Reusable Smart Cups:**
    * Temperature-maintaining smart cups with tracking capabilities.
    * Encourage reuse, reduce waste, and monitor environmental impact.
    * IoT-enabled usage tracking and lifetime warranty.

* **Plant-Based Cups:**
    * 100% biodegradable cups made from renewable plant materials.
    * Eliminate harmful chemicals and reduce carbon footprint.
    * Fully compostable and carbon-negative production.

* **Community Cup Program:**
    * Shared cup program with smart tracking and rewards for sustainable choices.
    * Foster community engagement and incentivize sustainable behavior.
    * Reward points system, community achievements, and impact tracking.
